# Versioning

Coldfront follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
Breaking changes can happen on the main branch at any time,
so it is recommended to pin haumea to a specific tag.

A list of available versions can be found on the
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/cryomancy/coldfront/releases) page.
